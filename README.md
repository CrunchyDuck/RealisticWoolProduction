# **(Slightly More) Realistic Wool Production**
Makes animals produce fleece from their fur when sheared instead of wool. This fleece is then processed at a tailor's bench in to wool.

## **Compatibility**
This mod is compatible with any animal mod that uses the core game wool.
When **VGP Garden Fabrics** is detected, the mod will automatically switch production of from the Tailor's Bench to the Loom included in Garden Fabrics.
When **AnimalCollabProj** is detected, will make any shearable animal produce fleece instead of wool.
These inclusions are **not dependancies**, and this mod will work with or without them.
This mod is save compatible.

If you want to add your own patch to the mod, you are invited to do a fork and a pull request in order to keep everything within the same mod. It would be very appreciated!

## **Future plans**
I plan on making a compatibility patch for mods that add in other animals in the future. If anyone wishes for a specific mod to be covered by this, let me know.

## **Credits**
Thanks a lot to **Yagiou** on Steam for information to do with patching.
Thanks to **lilwhitemouse** for the optimization fixes
