# **(Slightly More) Realistic Wool Production**
Makes animals produce fleece from their fur when sheared instead of wool. This fleece is then processed at a tailor's bench in to wool.

## **Compatibility**
Should be compatible with existing saves.
To uninstall, remove any fleece from the map with the "Destroy" tool, ensuring there's no fleece in pawn's (including trader's) inventories. Then, it should be fine to uninstall with no errors.
I'm uncertain on what other mods may conflict with this, so if someone discovers a mod, please notify me, and I'll work on fixing it.

## **Future plans**
I plan on making a compatibility patch for mods that add in other animals in the future. If anyone wishes for a specific mod to be covered by this, let me know, and I'll get to work on it immediately.
